# Display Ads

### Overview

Display ads are images/text/links you can add to the upper right and lower left sidebars of your community homepage.

On /admin/customization/display\_ads you'll see these attributes from the display ads that have been created for your community:

* Organization ID \#
* Organization Name
* Placement area \(left or ride sidebar\)
* Body Markdown 
* Published Status \(true or false\)
* Approved Status \(true or false\)
* Success Rate \(how often the ad is clicked\)

You'll also see an edit button to edit the display ad and a destroy button to completely remove it.

### How to Create a Display Ad 

Before you get started, you'll need an Organization ID \# to to create the ad. If you have not created an organization yet, you can do so [from your settings page](../community-tips/organization-pages.md). Once you've created an organization, you can look up the Organization ID \# by visiting /admin/organizations.

To create a new display ad, click the "Make A New Display Ad" button from /admin/display\_ads. This will bring you to a form with the following fields:

* Organization ID: add your organization id \#
* Body Markdown: add the markdown or html for your ad
* Placement Area: select left or right sidebar
* Published \(you will only see this if you are an admin\)
* Approved \(you will only see this if you are an admin\)

Here is an example of the body markdown from the image above:

```text
<a href="https://dev.to/devteam/join-us-in-celebrating-lgbtqia-pride-fp6">
    <img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/u0s38uu0cg1030f78uxw.png" height="300" width="300" />
</a>
<br>
<a href="https://dev.to/devteam/join-us-in-celebrating-lgbtqia-pride-fp6">
    <h2 style="text-align: center; line-height: 1.29em">Share Your Story</h2>
</a>
```

If you do not have publishing privileges, you'll need to ask an admin to approve and publish your display ad. 

_Please note: it'll take a few minutes for your display ad or any changes made to your display ad to appear on the home page._

_Additionally, if you attempt to publish a display ad and see an error, please make sure there is no space after the image source URL \(i.e. between `png`add the `"` mark in the example above\) as this can return an error._
