Guidance on launching your Forem ðŸš€

### Double-check your registration options

[Be sure to review the Authentication settings in Config](../admin/config/all-site-configuration/authentication.md) to ensure that your Forem is configured properly.  Is the community invite-only?  Fully public?  Make sure to configure your community properly on this page.

### Setting a Custom Domain

You likely have a `forem.cloud` subdomain, but it's highly likely that you'll want to set a custom domain before you officially launch your Forem.

[Please refer to the CNAME documentation for full instructions](cname.md).

### Contact Support

_Currently_, you'll need to contact the Forem Support to have your community go live on its custom domain.  Please contact us at [team@forem.com](mailto:team@forem.com) \(or send us a Slack Message if you have Priority Support\) when you're ready to make the domain switch.
