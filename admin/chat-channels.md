# Chat Channels

### Overview

Chat channels are group chats on Forem Connect, our messaging feature. Currently, only admins can create new chat channels.

### How to create a chat channel

Navigate to /admin/apps/chat\_channels and find the 'create channel' form. Fill out the following fields:

* Name of chat channel
* Usernames to add to the channel \(comma separated\). These users would be made moderators of the channel.
* Click "create chat channel"

Once a channel is created, the users added to the channel will be moderators and can now see the channel when they visit /connect.

### How to add and remove moderators from a chat channel

Navigate to /admin/apps/chat\_channels and search for the channel you'd like to update. In order to add a channel moderator, enter the username in the 'add user' column and click 'add users'. To remove a channel moderator, enter the username in the  'remove user' column and click 'remove user'.

### How to invite members \(non-moderators\) to your chat channel

Add members to your chat channel by visiting your channel and clicking on the channel name. When you click on the channel name, a panel will slide out. You can invite members to your channel in three ways:

#### 1. Usernames to invite

By adding the usernames of the members to the 'Usernames to invite' form. This will send them a notification where they can join the channel. Before they accept, their username will appear under 'pending invitations'. 

#### 2. Sharing an invitation link

You can give them a direct invitation link to join the channel. To find your invitation link:

* Go to "member list"
* Click "view all"
* Copy the invitation link
* Share the invitation link with whoever you're inviting

* Add a description
* Click "submit"
