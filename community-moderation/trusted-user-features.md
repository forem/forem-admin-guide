# Trusted User Features

### Overview

Trusted users are users with additional privileges across the platform. They have the ability to:

* Mark a post as high quality
* Mark a post as low quality
* Flag a post to admins
* Set the experience level of a post

To upgrade a user status to "trusted", [follow these instructions](../admin/users/manage-user.md#user-status).

### Mod Center

Once a user has the trusted status, they'll have access to the mod center by clicking the shield button on their nav bar.
