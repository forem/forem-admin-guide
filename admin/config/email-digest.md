# Email Digest

### Periodic email digest min/max

Email digests are automated emails sent to users that highlight suggested posts tailored to their interests. You can determine the minimum and maximum number of digest emails a user receives per week.

The final number they receive is determine by how often they interact with these emails. For instance, if a user frequently opens the email digest, our algorithm will send more digest emails.
