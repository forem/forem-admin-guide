# Tag Moderator Features

### Overview

Tag moderators are trusted users with an additional set of privileges related to the tags across your Forem. Familiarize yourself with the [trusted user features ](trusted-user-features.md)before diving into the additional features listed below. 

### Add or remove a tag

In addition to trusted user features, Tag moderators have the ability to add or remove their assigned tags from published posts. In order to take this action, the tag mod must leave a note explaining why they added or removed a tag. Their note will be sent to the user that authored the article via an on-site notification. 

The mod center allows tag moderators to quickly filter by their assigned tags in their inbox. 

Note: Tag moderators can only remove or add the tags they are assigned to, but admins can remove or add all tags.

### Edit Tag Pages

Tag Moderators can edit the tag page of the tag they are assigned to. They can do so by navigating to `/t/{tagname}/edit` . They will be presented with the following fields:

* Pretty name: name displayed on tag page
* Bg color hex: background color of the tag when it appears on posts
* Text color hex: font color of the tag when it appears on posts
* Short summary: a short description of the meaning of the tag
* Wiki Body Markdown: the 'about' section of the tag, accepts markdown
* Rules Markdown: the submission guidelines for posting under the tag, accepts markdown.

Here is a quick example of how these fields surface on the tag page:

#### Connect with other tag moderators

When a user becomes a tag moderator, they are automatically added to a group connect channel. We find that tag moderators enjoy chatting with one another and sharing advice on how to moderate the Forem. Tag mods should see the group channel when they visit /connect.
