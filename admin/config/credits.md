### About Credits

Credits enable users to purchase classified listings from your site. Listings can be considered a marketplace for the community -- users can offer their services, share events, list items for sale, etc.

### Credit Prices

We recommend tiered bulk pricing for credits \(i.e. the more credits someone buys, the cheaper each credit becomes\).

You can include up to four tiers of credit pricing:

* Small: less than 10 credits
* Medium: 10-99 credits
* Large: 100-999 credits
* Extra Large: 1000 credits or more

To define the price of a single credit, please include the USD cent value of one credit at each tier. Here's an example of our tiers:

* Small: 500 cents per credit
* Medium: 400 cents per credit
* Large: 300 cents per credit
* Extra Large: 250 cents per credit
