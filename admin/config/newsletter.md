# Newsletter

To set these newsletters, you'll first have to [make a Mailchimp account](https://login.mailchimp.com/signup/). Once you've created your account, you'll need to make an API key:

### Mailchimp API Key

### Main Newsletter

This is what DEV uses as their weekly newsletter that gets sent out every Monday. You can use this as your weekly newsletter through Mailchimp. Mailchimp calls these newsletters "audiences".

1. First, create an audience in Mailchimp: [https://us12.admin.mailchimp.com/lists/new-list/](https://us12.admin.mailchimp.com/lists/new-list/)
2. Fill out the fields accordingly and save.
3. Go to the "Settings" -&gt; "Audience name and defaults" 
4. On the right hand side, you'll see an Audience ID. Copy that and paste it into the Main Newsletter field in /admin/config:
