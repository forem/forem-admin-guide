# Quick Start Guide

This is a quick introduction to the most important features you need to know about as a Forem Creator.  In many cases, this page will link out to standalone pages in the admin guide for further information.

As you need additional assistance, [please refer to these resources](./#additional-resources).

### [Forem Basics in under 10 minutes \(video\)](https://www.loom.com/share/4cd18f6e15b94a818a7178a7aab20753)

Brand new Forem Creators should start off by [watching this quick introduction video](https://www.loom.com/share/4cd18f6e15b94a818a7178a7aab20753).  It covers the basics such as: accessing the admin area, setting a logo, changing colors, publishing a welcome thread, etc.

### Private Forem Link

* You've likely received your Forem Cloud subdomain, which looks something like this: `forem-742342330b2c53.forem.cloud`
* This is the pre-launch link for your Forem.  When you're ready to launch, [follow these instructions](going-live/cname.md) to update the domain name.

### Creating an Account

You'll create your account in one of three ways:

* **As the very first user:** Brand new forems are set up to allow the _very first_ to join as a superadmin.  [The page looks like this](https://p241.p3.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/8Lur2rXw/Image%202020-09-23%20at%2012.32.38%20PM.png?v=2586ca3f16619a91a725a15830599bf6).
* **Via Invite:** Superadmins are able to [invite a new user](admin/users/inviting-a-new-user.md) while the forem is still closed to public registrations \(via email/password or OAuth\).  If you're invited via this method, you'll receive an email [that looks like this](https://p241.p3.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/yAulGZGz/Image%202020-09-23%20at%2012.34.01%20PM.png?v=38e627261fb08d09d9da2ab87ec49c5c).
* **Via Regular Registration:** The default way that most community members will join your forem are using email/password, or an authentication provider such as Twitter, GitHub, or Facebook.  If this has already been configured on your forem, you'll be able to join with one of these methods.  [That page looks like this](https://p241.p3.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/GGurq2LE/Image%202020-09-23%20at%2012.36.40%20PM.png?v=dcbd6d263097dd1cbf21495f3e8f5bfa).

### Configuring your Forem as an Admin

As a superadmin, you're able to start configuring your forem.

* Please review to our [Config documentation](admin/config/), especially the [Get Started](admin/config/#get-started) section
* Additionally, you may be interesting in [inviting a new user](admin/users/inviting-a-new-user.md) and [elevating their role](admin/users/user-roles.md).

### Personalizing your Forem \(custom logo, images, colors\)

You'll likely want to customize your Forem.  Please check out the following pages:

* [Update images including your main logo](admin/config/images.md) 
* [Update the main brand color](admin/config/user-experience-and-brand.md#primary-brand-color-hex)

### Updating Tags

You should ensure that you have set up your main forem tags.

* [Tags instructions](admin/tags.md)

### Creating Pages

You can create pages on your Forem.

* [Creating pages](admin/pages.md)
* [Updating the Navigation sidebar](admin/navigation-links.md)

### Configuring Onboarding

You can customize your Forem onboarding:

* [Update onboarding images and options](admin/config/onboarding.md)

### Welcome Thread

You'll want to ensure that you've set up a welcome thread

* [Instructions for welcome threads](misc/setting-up-the-welcome-thread.md)

### Launching your Forem

Your forem likely won't live as a `forem.cloud` subdomain forever!  When you're ready to launch your Forem on your own domain refer to our "[Going Live](going-live/)" resources.
