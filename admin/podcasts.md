# Podcasts

### Overview

Your Forem has a built-in player that can support various podcasts. Podcasts are listed on /pod and if a user 'follows' a podcast, they will get an update on their feed when a new episode for that podcast has launched. When a podcast is played on platform, a player will appear at the bottom of the screen and the user is free to browse your Forem as they listen.

### How To Add A Podcast

In order to add a podcast, navigate to /pod and click "suggest a podcast". You will be presented with a form with the following fields:

* I am the owner of this podcast: check if true
* Title: title of the podcast
* Description: brief description of the podcast
* Website URL: website URL of the podcast
* Feed URL: RSS feed of the podcast

* Image: square image of your podcast album cover
* Pattern image: horizontal image of the banner that appears on your podcast page
* Android URL: listening link for Android
* Itunes URL: Apple podcast link
* Overcast URL: overcast URL

Click 'suggest' to enter the podcast into the system.

Once a podcast is suggested, navigate to /admin/podcasts and take these steps:

* Find your podcast and click the title
* Scroll to the bottom
* Check the checkbox "Reachable"

Once these steps are taken, you should be able to navigate to your podcast page \(i.e. /mypodcast\) and see all recent podcasts.
