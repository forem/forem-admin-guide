# Setting up the Welcome Thread

The "Welcome Thread" is one of the first things you should set up as a Forem Admin. It lives at `/welcome` and will be the main place that your community members introduce themselves.

The "official" Welcome Thread is the latest post published under the `#welcome` tag by the Site Staff User. You can adjust this Staff User ID in `Admin > Config > Community Content`.

An upcoming change \(when [this issue](https://github.com/forem/forem/issues/11455) is addressed\) will allow the canonical welcome thread to be authored by any admin, staff user, or mascot.
