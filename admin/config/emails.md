# Emails

### About

You can set different email addresses for different purposes in this area. The default email is used to send all automated emails to the community. 

Emails are sent using your community's name in the sender field, but by default, we're sending emails using the `noreply@forem.com` address. This is a pretty common pattern, so it shouldn't confuse your users.

We're relying on this approach in order to maximize domain trust and email deliverability, but once we have a good plan in place for optionally allowing you to customize the `from` domain, we'll let you know.

Additional email addresses you can specify include: 

* Business Inquiries \(i.e. partners@dev.to\)
* Privacy Concerns \(i.e. privacy@dev.to\)
* Members \(i.e. members@dev.to\)
  * We recommend setting a members email for a smaller group of people within your community. For example, paying members.
