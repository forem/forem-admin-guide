# Campaign

### Overview

Campaigns are a way to highlight information to your audience. You can use campaigns in whatever way suits your needs, but we toggle it during community celebrations or call-to-actions.

Campaign features include:

1. Large banner on home page
2. Highlighted articles under a certain tag\(s\) on home page righthand sidebar

You can choose to enable each feature individually or at the same time.
